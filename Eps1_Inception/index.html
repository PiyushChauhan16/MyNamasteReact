<!-- "Cross-origin" refers to interactions or 
requests that occur between different origins
 on the web. An origin is defined by a combination of the 
 following components:

Scheme: This is the protocol or method used, such as "http://" or "https://".

Domain: This is the host or server where a web resource is located, like "example.com" or "api.example.com".

Port: This is the port number used for communication, such as ":80" or ":443" (common HTTP and HTTPS ports).

 crossorigin Attribute: The crossorigin attribute
 is used to indicate that the loaded script should be 
 fetched with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions. 
 CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers that controls 
 how web pages can make requests to different origins (domains) for 
 resources like scripts, stylesheets, or data. -->
